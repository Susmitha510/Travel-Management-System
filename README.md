Travel Management System 
        A simple Java-based console application for travel bookings—users can register, browse trips, and book travel, while admins can manage schedules and oversee all activities. The system uses object-oriented programming principles and CSV files for data storage. Ideal for practicing core Java and file handling concepts!


🎯 Project Objective
To simulate a basic travel agency using Java and CSV-based data storage for learning purposes. Key concepts:

       Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

       File Handling (CSV)

       Console-based interaction

       User and admin role management



🧰 Tech Stack
Language: Java
Data Storage: CSV files (users.csv, trips.csv, bookings.csv, admin.csv)
Tools: VS Code / Sublime Text, Git, Java Compiler
Concepts Used:
       Inheritance

       Abstraction

       Exception Handling

       Encapsulation



👤 Features

User Module
Register and login as a user
View available trips
Book a trip
View your bookings
Admin Module
Admin login
Add or remove trips

Note: Only admins can add/remove trips or view all users/bookings.



🗂️ File Structure
Main.java
TravelManagementSystem.java
FileHandler.java
Booking.java
Trip.java
Admin.java
User.java
users.csv
trips.csv
bookings.csv
admin.csv
Compilation and execution format.txt



🚀 How to Run
Ensure Java is installed (java -version)

Open terminal/command prompt inside the project folder

Compile and run:

bash
javac Main.java
java Main



📌 Key Learning Highlights
Object-Oriented Design: Structured user, trip, booking, and admin functionality using core OOP

File I/O with CSV Persistence: No database used—practice handling data with CSV files

Exception Handling: Built-in checks for invalid input and operations

Modular Codebase: Cleanly separated models and utility classes



🏁 Project Status
This is a functional academic project. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Planned for future: Adding a GUI interface or switching to a database for persistent storage.
