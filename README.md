# 🧳 Travel Management System (Java Console App)

A simple Java-based console application that simulates a basic travel agency. Users can register, log in, browse available trips, and book travel, while admins can manage schedules and view all bookings. The project demonstrates core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and CSV-based file storage — ideal for beginners practicing modular code and file handling.
